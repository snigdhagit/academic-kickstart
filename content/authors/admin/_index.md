I am a statistician exploring the potential of new methods at the intersections of machine learning, probabilistic modeling, data science and genomics. My current research activities are specially focused on reconciling between inferential coherence and adaptive modeling, a conï¬‚ict unavoidable with many large-scale complex data analyses. My work aims at advancing methodology backed by theory and developing algorithms to translate these methods into practice.
