  * A comprehensive treatment of linear models for independent observations using least squares estimation, including both simple and multiple regression
  * Some regression methods for dependent data
  * Automated variable selection algorithms from a competing class of linear models such as L-1 and L-2 penalized algorithms
  * Permutation tests and bootstrapped regression methods
  * Challenges from a modern regression (learning) perspective: multiple comparisons, multiple testing and inference post selection. """

  description = """This course will be centered around modern topics in selective inference.

  * Relevance of selective inference in a modern scientific realm : Distinguishing between exploratory and confirmatory statistics, we will discuss the notions of Family wise error rate and False Discovery rate.
  * Is a statistician's job done after exploratory analysis once we report a principled list of potential discoveries? : We will visit two main approaches in the modern literature, a simultaneous take and a conditional take to selective inferential problems after introducing the false coverage rate control.
  * What if we collect new data? After all, science is iterative in nature! : A realistic pipeline in science proceeds via multiple complicated steps and calibrates the next steps in the pipeline based upon previous results. We will look at new methods to combine fresh data with previously collected data for powerful inference.
  * Powerful science is being redefined through integrative analyses : Special structure inducing penalties, distributed computing environments, multiple data sources playing diverse roles in a pipeline etc. are part of this discourse. We will think of tools in order to adapt to this modern class of problems. """
